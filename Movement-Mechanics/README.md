## Soild-Works and Concept Design
First, Let's design the bot's movement functionality. So since we deal with liquids on slippery surfaces we need a method of movement that is not complicated and slip-resistant.

Therefore, a simple 2-wheel drive (FWD) system with a loose steel ball at the back provides stability.

So first things first, let's build our wheel and gear part so that we can then run tests on it. 

Using Solidworks 3D CAD software and a couple of minutes we have our part:

As you can see the blue part of the assembly is the wheel. I decided to add a notch so that I could fill it with a type of water-absorbant material to provide as much traction as possible. 

The gear is fixed to the wheel as this would be powered by a motor through another gear. The gear calculations are as follows:
